Four solutions to the MM-AI problem

`cpp1` - introduces a solution using hashmaps and bitvectors

`cpp2` - introduces a naive solution using for loops and no major data-structures

`java` - contains the naive solution in both `cpp1` and `cpp2`

GFG permutations is incorrect. need to fix
start at line 114 for MasterMindNew.java --- need method to find an element in a Java HashSet
